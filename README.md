i didn't focus on implementing the following : 
1- form validation 
2- regular attendance 

all i wanted to do is controlled system listening to employees attemps to join and take their attendance 

some feautures i have build by myself : 
1 - simple pubsub : to ease the stae management solution with me .. 
2- pure java script was pain in neck without using pubsub pattern 
3- i designed two pool apis to listen on changes with the localStorage and fetch the updated data and update the ui automatic

#some bad things i did : 
## the code was so heavy because i was working on c++ and SQL in the same time so i lost control on my code structure .. 
but next release i will fix all the bugs and clean the code which repeated a lot in security file ..
